SNL Saturday night live is dead if it cannot parody itself.

snl cannot parody itself therefore it is dead.

all comedians are dead.

snl is a comedy death camp.

all comesians learn bad jokes in a camp.

comedians are forced to tell terrible jokes.

this situation takes place in the barracks.

no commanders or any authorighty is noticed.

zoom in on brown tents.

there is a comedy bar inside but everyone is pissed drunk or just tired and hungry for a good joke.

they eat jokes in a surrealistic way.

they tell a joke then a meter goes up and all the comedians eat a jone.

retell the best snl comedy bits as parodies.
